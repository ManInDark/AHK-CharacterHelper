# AHK-Scripts

These scripts can be used to improve certain parts of using a windows system. The currently working scripts are listed below.

---
## Letters

This script helps in writing scientific text more quickly, as it allows access to unusual characters (greek letters, mathematical characters, arrows, ...) that aren't on normal keyboards by writing other characters which then get replaced. In case one forgets what those other characters are, "help" can be typed to show a window where all characters are listed next to their replacements.

Note: the ringoperator presented in the mathematical characters section isn't the one that should be used for scalar multiplication according to [Wikipedia](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malzeichen#Skalarprodukt_und_Kreuzprodukt) (German), but as it looks right it's left as is.

## SoundControl

This script is useful for controlling presentations or similar things that are controlled by left and right arrow keys with a bluetooth headset or any other device that allows the sending of the Play/Pause and the Next input.

# Installation

In case you want to use the scripts without modifying them and without installing AutoHotkey you can simply download them from the most recent release. If you already have AutoHotkey installed, you can just download the .ahk Files from the newest successful commit too.
